For this assignment, I recieved help in a BCS tutoring session with Simon. First, he helped me to identify what I had done incorrectly when creating my data_clean dataframe and to implement the .isin() function. This gave me the proper results in all the code I had worked ahead on beyond that point, with the exception of the "Quartiles, Outliers, and Boxplots" section. Simon also helped me create the for loop and the box plot.
